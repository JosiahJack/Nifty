                   Add Fonts.zip

To improve the readability of the document files 
included with my Real World Coaster Track Packs, please
add these new Fonts to your Windows\Fonts folder.

              Installation Instructions

1.  Unzip (decompress) the AddFonts.zip file 
accompanying this Readme.txt file.

2.  Copy, (highlight and drag) the new fonts to your
C:\Windows\Fonts folder.  There is no install program
required.

3.  Reboot your Windows.  

4.  These new fonts will now appear in the Windows Fonts
selections under Wordpad, or other Windows wordprocessor
programs.  

5.  My document files will now appear as they were 
originally written.

These Fonts may be freely distributed.
