The Mod Check Utility for Quake (1996)

This is intended to be used to check Quake map packs prior to release to confirm that all is setup correctly.  Check all the little annoying easy to miss things automatically!

Also used to check Quake qc code for errors or to generate statistics and other information from them.  Useful for comparisons.
